# Toy-problem

Prerequisites: 

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.

Instructions:

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

 

Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

 

Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

Description:

Solution 1- This fuction allows the user to input the score received and in return they get to receive the grade as the output from the function.

Solution 2- For this solution the function reads the speed the driver is on and loops through the function to output a response a response that lets the driver know whether they are under the speed limit or will end up getting points deducted if the were above the speed limit.

Solution 3- This function receives the basic salary of employees as well as their benefits to determine their net salary by calculating the; paye, nhif and nssf deductions from the gross income. It outputs the net salary.
